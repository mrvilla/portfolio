	<div class="article__content">
		<p>My family named me Enrique, but people call me Henry.</p>
		<p>I'm international; parents from Colombian, but I was born in Caracas, been fortunate to live in various places, like NY, BPT, Caracas, Madrid, Berlin, and Stockholm.</p>
		<p>Studied architecture, which I left to follow my artistic passion, then became an independent artist and illustrator for several years.</p>
		<p>10 years ago, I started as a UI Designer, which later led me to be a Front-end Developer. Throughout this career, I have worked on multiple projects and products with great people in different teams within various industries.</p>
		<p>Beyond this, I'm passionate about staying creative and continue to explore my artistic skills. In my free time, I enjoy taking Black & White Photography and capture the world from above with my drone creating some photography and short videos.</p>
		<p>My curiosity to know how something works helps me discover and learn more which broadens my perspectives.</p>
		<p>Today I continue to collaborate with teams to build amazing things with them and continue to have fun with my own hobbies, while listening to some good music, drinking hell of a lot coffee and enjoy eating pizza.</p>
